TaskRef: "Add debug logs for detect_plateau in app/src/main.c"

Learnings:
- Added multiple LOG_DBG statements to trace the plateau detection algorithm's state, including buffer operations, calibration triggers, first measurement handling, delta/epsilon calculations, difference counting logic, and plateau detection decisions
- Used appropriate format specifiers (%.3f, %.4f, %d) for logging floating point and integer values in embedded C

Difficulties:
- Had to carefully match exact indentation and whitespace in SEARCH/REPLACE block to ensure successful replacement
- Ensured LOG_DBG calls were correctly placed to not interfere with algorithm logic

Successes:
- Successfully added comprehensive debugging logs that provide visibility into algorithm behavior
- Logs will facilitate debugging and verification of plateau detection during testing

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General logging practice: Include function entry logs with key parameters, decision branch logs, and appropriate precision for data types
- SEARCH/REPLACE best practices: Break large code changes into smaller blocks if whitespace matching becomes challenging; carefully construct SEARCH blocks to include sufficient context for unique matching
